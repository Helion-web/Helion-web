# 👋 Hi, I’m Helion

I'm a passionate **DevOps Engineer** who loves automating infrastructure, building CI/CD pipelines, and optimizing system performance. I work with a variety of tools and technologies to help teams deliver better software faster and more reliably.

-  I’m currently learning more about **Kubernetes** and **Cloud Architecture** to further improve my DevOps skills.
-  Fun fact: My projects are usually fueled by 50 cups of coffee and 20 hours of sleep deprivation.
